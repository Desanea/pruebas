#Variables are memory location to store values (data that we assign)
age=20
print(age)
sentence = "My name is Ramon"
print(sentence)

#Multiple assigment. We have different variables
Sarah=16
bob=21
Mike=18
#This is tedious, as we have to create a variable in every line. Best way is to do this,
#assign all valuables in one single line

Sarah, bob, Mike = 16,21,18

#Now If we want only one valuable we print the name and the age will pop up
print(bob)
print(Sarah)
print(Mike)


#Now let's in one line have two variables
name, age = "Ramon", 45
print(name)
print(age)
